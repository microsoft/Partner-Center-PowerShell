# Upcoming Breaking Changes

## Release 2.0.1910.1 - October 2019

* Usage
  * Removed the `Get-PartnerCustomerSubscriptionUsage` command due to changes with the Partner Center SDK for .NET. This command will be replaced with the [Get-PartnerCustomerSubscriptionMeterUsage](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/partnercenter/Get-PartnerCustomerSubscriptionMeterUsage) and [Get-PartnerCustomerSubscriptionResourceUsage](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/partnercenter/Get-PartnerCustomerSubscriptionResourceUsage) commands

## Release 2.0.1909.1 - September 2019

* Authentication
  * Environments have been renamed to match the Azure PowerShell module. The new values are: *AzureChinaCloud*, *AzureCloud*, *AzureGermanCloud*, *AzurePPE*, and *AzureUSGovernment*
  * Replaced the `Consent` parameter with the `UseAuthorizationCode` parameter for the `New-PartnerAccessToken` cmdlet
  * Replaced the `Resource` parameter with the `Scopes` parameter for the `Connect-PartnerCenter` and `New-PartnerAccessToken` cmdlets
  * ServicePrincipal parameter is now required when using a confidential client with the `Connect-PartnerCenter` and `New-PartnerAccessToken` cmdlets
  * When using the [New-PartnerAccessToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/partnercenter/new-partneraccesstoken) command and the `UseAuthorizationCode` parameter you will be prompted to authentication interactively using the authorization code flow. The redirect URI value will generated dynamically. This generation process will attempt to find a port between 8400 and 8999 that is not in use. Once an available port has been found, the redirect URL value will be constructed (e.g. <http://localhost:8400>). So, it is important that you have configured the redirect URI value for your Azure Active Directory application accordingly.
* Module
  * The `PartnerCenter` module now supports PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell, as a result the `PartnerCenter.NetCore` module will be retired

## Release 1.5.1906.1 - June 2019

* Agreements
  * The *UserId* parameter will be removed from the [New-PartnerCustomerAgreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/partnercenter/new-partnercustomeragreement) command. Enhancements to the API have been to derive this value based on the authenticated user

## Release 1.5.1905.1 - May 2019

* Subscriptions
  * The *AutoRenew* flag will be removed from the [Set-PartnerCustomerSubscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/partnercenter/set-partnercustomersubscription) command
